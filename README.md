# Vertical-Shooter-Game
Designed for my Data Structures & Algorithms course, this game features wizards casting magical spells against the goblins.

## Project Details
My teaching assistant designed the renderer and visuals, but I programmed the project in C#. This game incorporates doubly linked lists and queues to manage the wizard team and goblin line.
